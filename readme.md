 * Run `npm install`

 * Run `npm start` (opens bowser window, else got to http://localhost:3000/)

 * All of this is only needed to have a server that serves the content of `app`

 * `app` contains chart.js and an `index.html` that loads `auto.esm.js` as module.

 * Open the console in the browser and reload. See the error message.

 * Add `.js` as suggested in the bug report, reload and see the error disappear.
